        The death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio's imprisonment were soon reported in the province, and to the honor of the
        simple inhabitants of San Diego, let it be recorded that the latter was the incident more regretted and almost the
        only one discussed. As was to be expected, the report took on different forms, sad and startling details were given,
        what could not be understood was explained, the gaps being filled by conjectures, which soon passed for
        accomplished facts, and the phantoms thus created terrified their own creators.

        water was somewhat dirty, he wouldn't cross himself with it. He talked about germs and disease, aba, it's the
        chastisement of God! He deserved it, and he got it! As though the holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the
        contrary, aba'!"
